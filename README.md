<h1>1. CAC Dashboard</h1>
During my summer internship, I build a Customer Acquisition Dashboard, resulting in a 20% increase in the company's ability to identify and engage potential clients.<br>
Creating the end product isn't straightforward. First, I clean the data frame which is the most time-consuming process. Later, extract insights from the sheet, and then construct the dashboard.
